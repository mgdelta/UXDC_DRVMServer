/* Some word about this interface:
 * Syntax3 means some special things to take care about. The default value of a single signal is by default 0. 
 * If this signal is not set to a value other than 0, this signal will not be transfered. In addition, when all signals of a 
 * message are 0, the message itself becomses 0 and will not be tranferred. 
 * The subscriber would not recognize this behaviour. Take care about this during implementation.
 * Also, keep your attention on signal ranges with a 0 as a valid value.
